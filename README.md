# The Simon Game

## Description
This project tries to recreate the mythical Simon game.

## Instructions
To start the game we must click on any key. After starting the game, it will create a pattern that the user must try to copy and replicate.

And as you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated, and at some point, you're going to mess it up, and it's going to say you got it wrong and it's game over, so you can press any key to restart the game.
